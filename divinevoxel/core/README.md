**WARNING:**
This is not finalized. Things will keep changing as development goes forward.
Use a stable release for development.

# What is this?

A truly multi-threaded JavaScript voxel game engine written in TypeScript that uses Babylon.Js.

## Features

- Different voxel types and shapes.
- Chunk-based rendering and meshing.
- In parallel mesh building, light updates, and other world updates.
- Multi-threaded data access.
- Ambient occlusion and smooth lighting.
- Animated and connected textures.
- Custom shaders and shader effects.
- Vertical and horizontal chunks.
- Voxel Lighting system.
  - Easy to update and remove.
  - Support for different colored lights.
  - Sunlight global illumination.
- World Data API - Easy tools to build worlds.
- Easy to use auto-update world on voxel add/remove
  - Will auto update light sources for you.

## In Development

- Headless server use.
- Physics and collision detection.
  - Working to develop some helper functions to determine what voxel the player is looking at or touching.
  - Instead of using collision detection with the actual meshes it will calculate collision in the world thread.
- Liquid flow and magma flow like Minecraft.
- Same voxel different colors
  - Set a color directly on voxel data.
  - Options to create shade gradient with neighbors.
- Well-written wiki with tutorials on how to do anything that you could possibly want.
- Standard data format for the engine that will be called either .dsd or .dved for saving the world data and or structures.

## Long Term Goals

- Dynamic Lighting system.
  - Will use Babylon's built-in dyamic lights and shadow casting.
- More shader effects and custom voxel substances
- Structure creator software.
